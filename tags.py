"""
The task here is to explore the data a bit more.
Before we process the data and add it into our database, we should check the
"k" value for each "<tag>" and see if there are any potential problems.

We have 3 regular expressions to check for certain patterns
in the tags. We would like to change the data
model and expand the "addr:street" type of keys to a dictionary like this:
{"address": {"street": "Some value"}}
So, we have to see if we have such tags, and if we have any tags with
problematic characters.

The following function 'key_type' gets a count of each of
four tag categories in a dictionary:
  "lower", for tags that contain only lowercase letters and are valid,
  "lower_colon", for otherwise valid tags with a colon in their names,
  "problemchars", for tags with problematic characters, and
  "other", for other tags that do not fall into the other three categories.
